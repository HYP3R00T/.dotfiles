# .dotfiles

## About the Project  

This repository is a complete solution for managing system configurations (dotfiles) and automating system setup with Ansible.  

I created this project to:  

- Streamline the process of configuring new systems.  
- Automate repetitive tasks, like installing packages and applying settings.  
- Make it easy to maintain a consistent environment across multiple devices.  

In this repository, youâ€™ll find:  

1. My Dotfiles Setup: The exact configuration I use for my systems, organized and automated.  
2. Step-by-Step Guides: Learn how to create your own dotfiles repository and automate your setup.  

Whether you're a beginner or experienced, this project will help you understand the power of dotfiles and automation tools like Ansible.

## Whatâ€™s in This Repository?  

- My Dotfiles Setup:  
  Explore the configuration files I use for tools like Bash, Zsh, Vim, and more. These are managed using Ansible for easy setup on new machines.  

- Documentation Site:  
  This site (hosted via GitHub Pages) serves as a guide to help anyone:  
  1. Understand how I built this system.  
  2. Learn how to create their own dotfiles setup.  

- Scripts and Playbooks:  
  Ready-to-use scripts and Ansible playbooks for automated installation and configuration.  

---

## How This Works  

1. Dotfiles Repository:  
   My dotfiles are stored in this repo and organized into logical sections (e.g., shell, editor, tools).  

2. Ansible for Automation:  
   Ansible playbooks handle tasks like installing packages, setting up configurations, and applying custom settings.  

3. Installation Script:  
   A single script (`install.sh`) applies the configurations automatically on any system.
