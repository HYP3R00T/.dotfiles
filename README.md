# .dotfiles

## Just for me

The following command is NOT for you. It's for me only.

```shell
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HYP3R00T/.dotfiles/main/bin/install.sh | bash
```
## How to use it?

If you want to use my `.dotfiles`, then please fork it first. Then modify the `vars.yml` file as it contains all the variables that is specific to me. Once you have done that, you can create your own command using the following template.

```shell
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<your-github-username>/<name-of-the-forked-repo>/main/bin/install.sh | bash
```
